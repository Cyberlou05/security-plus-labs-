# Security+ Labs — Index

Hands-on mini labs aligned to CompTIA Security+ concepts. All demos are educational — run in an isolated VM or environment you control.

## Labs
- [Hashcat Demo](hashcat_demo.md) — demo hash cracking workflow (owned/test hashes only).
- [Firewall Rules](firewall_rules.md) — iptables / ufw examples and AWS Security Group notes.
- [GPG Demo](gpg_demo.md) — key generation, encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify.

## How to use
1. Clone repository and open `/labs`.
2. Read each README and run commands in a safe VM.
3. Do not commit private keys or real secrets.
